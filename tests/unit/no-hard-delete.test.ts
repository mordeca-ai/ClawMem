/**
 * T0 containment — ClawMem never physically deletes a document row (BACKLOG Source 55 §55.5).
 *
 * The governing rule is "no unrecoverable model-mediated mutation". Deactivation, archival
 * and forgetting are all reversible; a `DELETE FROM documents` is not. Through v0.29.0 three
 * paths reached one — an agent-invoked MCP tool, an unattended SessionStart hook, and the
 * CLI — plus two unguarded store methods with no callers.
 *
 * These tests assert the CORRECT behavior (nothing is destroyed), not the behavior that
 * shipped. They exercise real code paths rather than scraping source text for call
 * patterns: a source regex stays green if a caller uses an alias, a helper, or raw SQL.

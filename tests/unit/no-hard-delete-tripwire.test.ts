/**
 * T0 containment, DB-level — a delete leaves durable evidence, on the paths this drives.
 *
 * The sibling suite (`no-hard-delete.test.ts`) checks known method shapes, which cannot see
 * a destructive helper that takes arguments, a module-level export not attached to `Store`,
 * or raw SQL issued from MCP / REST / hook / CLI / plugin code. This suite instead installs
 * an AFTER DELETE trigger on `documents` that records every deleted row into an audit table,
 * then drives the REAL production surfaces and asserts the audit table is empty.
 *
 * It RECORDS rather than ABORTs, deliberately. An aborting trigger raises a SQLite error,
 * and `stalenessCheck` wraps its lifecycle work in a fail-open `catch {}` — so a delete
 * reintroduced in the hook would abort, be swallowed, and leave the row counts looking
 * correct. That swallowed-error shape is exactly how the original unattended purge survived
 * for months, so the guard must not depend on an exception surviving the call stack. An
 * audit row cannot be caught.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated plainly: this verifies the paths it drives — the MCP `lifecycle_sweep` tool
 * and the `stalenessCheck` hook, plus the store maintenance surface. The REST routes, the
 * CLI dispatch, and the OpenClaw/Hermes plugins are NOT exercised here and are not covered.
 * Adding a surface is a few lines; claiming coverage without driving it is not.
 *
